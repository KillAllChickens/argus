> _"The all-seeing one."_

Named after the hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology, Argus Panoptes is a powerful OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) tool designed to uncover the digital footprint of a specific username. Just as his mythological namesake served as a vigilant watchman, this tool scans the web to identify websites where a target username is registered.

For better accuracy, Argus Panoptes can use Google Gemini to filter out false positives, making results as precise as possible.

## ‚ú® Features

- üöÄ **Blazing Fast, Multi-threaded Scanning:** In testing, single username scans across **160+ sites** completed in under **5 seconds**.
  - **Note:** Enabling AI-powered scanning will limit the thread count to **5** to prevent rate-limiting, which will result in a significant slowdown.
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered False Positive Detection:** Uses Google Gemini for more accurate identification of user profiles.
- üîß **Highly Customizable:** Tailor the site list, user agents, soft 404 detection, and even the ASCII art to your preferences.
- üìÑ **Flexible Output Formats:** Export scan results in various formats, including PDF, HTML, JSON, and TXT.

## Usage

### Configuration

To enable the AI-powered false positive detection, you'll need to add your Google Gemini API key.

To configure your API key, simply run:

```bash
argus config
# or for short:
argus c
```

### Scanning

- **Scan for a single user:**

  ```bash
  argus scan <username>
  ```

- **Scan for multiple users:**

  ```bash
  argus scan <user1> <user2> <user3>
  ```

- **Scan usernames from a file:**
  Use a `.txt` file with one username per line. For more details, see the [Usernames](#-usernames) section.

  ```bash
  argus scan -u <filename.txt>
  ```

- **Output to different file types:**

  ```bash
  # Output to HTML (default: results/<username>_results.html)
  argus scan <username> --html

  # Output to PDF (default: results/<username>_results.pdf)
  argus scan <username> --pdf

  # Output to JSON (default: results/<username>_results.json)
  argus scan <username> --json

  # Output to Text (default: results/<username>_results.txt)
  argus scan <username> --txt

  # Output to all supported formats

## üìù Usernames

### Command-Line Usernames

You can specify usernames directly in the command line after the `scan` command.

Use `{?}` as a wildcard to scan for variations of a username. It will be replaced with `-`, `_`, and nothing.

**Example:**

```bash
# This will scan for "username", "user-name", and "user_name"
argus scan "user{?}name"
```

### Username Files

For bulk scanning, you can provide a text file with one username per line.

- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and will be ignored.
- Blank lines are also ignored.

**Example `users.txt`:**

```
# This line will be ignored
user1
user2 # This will also be ignored
user3
```
